	<h2>Want to Be an Artist?</h2>
	<p>"True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist," says Albert Einstein. While some incredibly, lucky people are simply born with the gift of artistic prowess, others have to study to become fluent in the language of art. Whichever path you are on, be aware that everyone is an artist.Some people just let their creative urges out more easily and completely than others. If the artistic path is calling you, begin the journey with tiny steps and follow it. This article is going to show you how to become a true artist in no time.
